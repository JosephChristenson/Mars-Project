	This is an image of the entire map that I was given. You can see the section
	of the map that we used in our output on the middle right side. It is hard
	to see since there isn't much change in color for any of the chasms or craters. 

![molaout](./MolaOut.png)

	This is the output that we got from the program when we set the coordinates
	for that chasm. as you can see the lines show the change in elevation, although
	when i reviewed his example it had much more lines and lines that were far thicker
	and thus more visible than the ones we used. That may have been an aesthetic change 
	that he made to make it easily seen.
